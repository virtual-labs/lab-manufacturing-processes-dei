  "introduction": "Welcome to the Manufacturing Processes (Foundry & Casting) Virtual Simulation Lab. Casting is a manufacturing process in which molten metal is poured into a pre-designed mould cavity and then left to solidify. Final solidified product of this process is known as casting which needs various post-processing operations. Using this Virtual simulation lab students will be able to visualize and simulate various casting experiments taught in the university, on his/her computer.",
